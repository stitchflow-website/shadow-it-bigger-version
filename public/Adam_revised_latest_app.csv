Graph Explorer is primarily a development and testing tool for Microsoft Graph API, used by specific technical teams rather than deployed company-wide. While critical for teams working with Microsoft 365 data and services, it's not typically considered mission-critical for entire organizations.","Software Development, IT Administration, System Integration, Data Analytics, and Microsoft 365 Administration teams. Most valuable for technical teams that need to interact with Microsoft Graph APIs to access organizational data or build applications integrated with Microsoft services.","Moderate to high. If compromised, an attacker could potentially gain access to organizational data accessible through Microsoft Graph, including emails, files, user information, and other Microsoft 365 resources. This could lead to data breaches, exposure of sensitive information, and possible compliance violations. However, impact is limited by proper authentication and authorization controls in production environments.","Moderately positive sentiment: Users appreciate Graph Explorer as Microsoft's official tool for testing and exploring Microsoft Graph APIs.

Documentation and sample queries are available to assist, but users without API experience would benefit from training sessions.","Low-Medium risk, Tier 2 (Mature security program). As a Microsoft product, Graph Explorer benefits from Microsoft's enterprise-grade security infrastructure. It uses Azure AD for authentication, implements permission scopes, and follows Microsoft's compliance frameworks. Since it's a tool for accessing organizational data via Graph API, proper permission management is essential to mitigate risks.","No direct subscription required for Graph Explorer itself as it's a free developer tool. However, accessing certain Microsoft Graph endpoints may require appropriate Microsoft 365 or Azure subscriptions. The licensing terms for those services would apply to the data accessed through Graph Explorer rather than the tool itself.",Graph Explorer is primarily a testing tool for developers and administrators to explore Microsoft Graph capabilities before implementing them in applications. It maintains session tokens securely but requires users to understand permission scopes to prevent overly broad access grants. Microsoft regularly updates the tool with new Graph API features.
